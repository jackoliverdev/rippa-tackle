# RIPPA DEMO PROJECT BRIEF

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Client**: Jacob Worth (@jacob_londoncarper) - Rippa Tackle  
**Store**: rippatackle.com (Shopify-powered)  
**Developer**: You (UK-based software dev & carp angler)  
**Goal**: Build impressive demo to secure £5k headless Shopify rebuild contract  
**Timeline**: Demo needed ASAP for upcoming call with Jacob  

## CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS

### Existing Site Issues
- **Boring Generic Template**: Standard Shopify theme, zero personality
- **Poor Product Discovery**: Basic grid layout, weak categorization
- **Weak Bundle/Mystery Box Presentation**: Static images, no interactivity
- **Amateur Visual Hierarchy**: Cluttered navigation, poor information architecture
- **Backend Pain Points**: Standard Shopify admin - Jacob wants easier product/order management

### Client Background
- **Jacob Worth**: Professional carp angler turned tackle business owner
- **Pain Point**: Spends too much time on admin, wants more time fishing
- **Business Model**: Fishing tackle + bait + mystery boxes + specialized bundles
- **Target Audience**: UK carp anglers (rig builders, bait seekers, gear enthusiasts)

## TECHNICAL STRATEGY

### Chosen Approach: Headless Shopify
**Why Headless Wins:**
- ✅ Keep existing Shopify backend (inventory, orders, payments)
- ✅ Build custom React/Next.js frontend
- ✅ Zero payment integration risk
- ✅ Faster demo development
- ✅ Easy to showcase "before/after"

### Tech Stack
```
Frontend: Next.js 14 + React + TypeScript
Styling: Tailwind CSS
Backend: Shopify Storefront API + Admin API
Database: Shopify (products/orders) + Supabase (user data/AI interactions)
AI: OpenAI GPT-4 (bundle builder)
Deployment: Vercel (free tier)
Auth: Firebase Auth (your boilerplate)
```

## SUCCESS METRICS

### Immediate Demo Goals
- [ ] Jacob says "Fuck me, how'd you do that?"
- [ ] Secures follow-up technical discussion
- [ ] Gets agreement on headless approach
- [ ] Closes £5k contract

### Project Success Criteria (Post-Demo)
- 35% improvement in conversion rate

## TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS

### Shopify Limitations to Address
- Rate limiting on API calls

- Checkout flow customization limits

### Performance Targets
- <2s page load times
- 90+ Lighthouse score
- Mobile-first optimization
- Image lazy loading throughout

## CONTINGENCY PLANS

### If Demo Breaks During Call
1. Have local backup ready
2. Screen recording of full demo as fallback
3. Static images of key features prepared

### If Jacob Prefers Different Approach
- Be flexible on timeline/budget
- Offer PHP/Shopify Liquid alternative if needed
- Pivot to API integration focus if preferred

---

**Bottom Line**: Build something that makes Jacob think "This guy gets fishing AND tech" while solving his real business problems. The AI bundle builder is your ace card - no other tackle shop has anything close.

**Remember**: Keep it fishing-focused, technically impressive, but explain in terms Jacob understands. You're not just building a website, you're giving him more time on the bank.
